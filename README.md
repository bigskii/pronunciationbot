# Pronunciation
Python bot that automates the creation of pronunciation guide YouTube videos.  
Does not upload any videos, just creates and saves them.  
This branch does not include the text at the bottom, favorable if you want the most recent Pillow version.

- [gTTS library](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)
